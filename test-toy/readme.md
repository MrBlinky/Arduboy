# Hardware Test Toy

Mainly written to test the hardware and libraries for Arduboy and clones. But it
also fun to fool around with.

Going to a concert? No need to take a lighter or a flashlight with you. Pull your
Arduboy out of your pocket, select your personalized color and start waving! xD

**Hex** folder contains. **.hex** files for Arduboy and different variants.
